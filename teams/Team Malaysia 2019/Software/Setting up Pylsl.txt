On Windows:

1. open a cmd window with administrator rights
2. go to your python install folder and in 'scripts' using the cd command
	(probably C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts)
3. pip install pylsl

tkinter library is already included in python!



On Raspberry Pi:

1. Pylsl-library download using $pip3 install pylsl 
2. find folder /home/pi/.local/python3.5/pylsl 
3. replace entire library with either liblsl_python or liblsl all language python
4. liblsl-bcm2708.so from folder C_C++ rename to liblsl32.so and copy into python3.5
